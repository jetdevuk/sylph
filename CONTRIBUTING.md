# Contributing to Sylph

The sylph platform welcomes issues, pull requests and feedback from any developer willing to put in the time to contribute. Below you can find a couple things to keep in mind when contributing, and see examples of how we like to do things here!

## About: Security

If you have found a security flaw/vulnerability in Sylph or any of the libraries used in the project, please follow the guidelines in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). This will always be kept updated with the best way to alert maintainers to any serious problems.

## About: Issues

Issues are an important part of any project, if you spot a problem with Sylph, its documentation, failing tests under certain conditions or problems that only appear in certain environments, feel free to open an issue! The title should be short and describe the problem, and the issue body should go into as much detail as possible. Please include anything that you believe could help us reproduce the issue, or even guidance if you know what should be done to resolve the problem.

Not every issue is an issue, sometimes you're just interested in suggesting new features that would fit in well with the library. In this case **the issue should be marked with the 'enhancement' label**. A descriptive and punchy title with a summary of the proposed feature or concept and how it would fit into the ecosystem should be included. If you want you can also add more details on implementation inside the issue body or as a comment beneath.

To summarise:

- Short descriptive title
- Detailed summary inside the body
- Reproduction steps
- Potential implementation/solution

## About: Documentation

If possible every pull request should update/add to the documentation relating to the feature that is being worked on so it doesn't fall out of sync with the rest of the project. If you're interested in improving the documentation for a current feature then your pull request will always be considered!

## About: Features

Another way to contribute to Sylph is to solve one of the many [Issues](https://github.com/jetdevuk/sylph/issues). Unassigned milestone features are the best things to work on and most likely to get accepted, though any contributions are considered so don't be afraid to draw outside the lines if you believe it can be a real benefit to the project!
